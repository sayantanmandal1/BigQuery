# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enterprise Knowledge Intelligence Platform is a revolutionary AI-powered system that transforms how organizations extract actionable insights from their vast, heterogeneous data repositories. Unlike traditional analytics tools that work in silos, this platform seamlessly integrates structured business data with unstructured content (documents, images, videos, chat logs) to provide real-time, context-aware intelligence that drives strategic decision-making.

The platform addresses the critical challenge faced by modern enterprises: they possess enormous amounts of valuable data across multiple formats and systems, but lack the ability to synthesize this information into coherent, actionable insights. This solution leverages BigQuery's cutting-edge AI capabilities across all three approaches (Generative AI, Vector Search, and Multimodal) to create an unprecedented level of business intelligence automation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Intelligent Document Discovery and Analysis

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want to instantly find and analyze relevant documents, reports, and communications across our entire enterprise data ecosystem, so that I can make informed decisions based on comprehensive historical context and similar past scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a natural language query THEN the system SHALL use vector embeddings to find semantically similar documents across all enterprise repositories with 95%+ relevance accuracy
2. WHEN relevant documents are identified THEN the system SHALL automatically generate comprehensive summaries highlighting key insights, decisions, and outcomes using generative AI
3. WHEN multiple document types are found THEN the system SHALL create a unified analysis that synthesizes insights from text documents, presentation slides, and image-based reports
4. IF the query involves financial or performance data THEN the system SHALL automatically correlate findings with structured business metrics and generate trend analysis

### Requirement 2: Predictive Business Intelligence Generation

**User Story:** As an executive, I want the system to proactively identify emerging trends, risks, and opportunities by analyzing patterns across all our data sources, so that I can make strategic decisions before competitors and market conditions change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new data is ingested THEN the system SHALL automatically generate forecasts for key business metrics using AI.FORECAST with confidence intervals
2. WHEN anomalies are detected in any data stream THEN the system SHALL generate detailed explanations and recommended actions using generative AI
3. WHEN market conditions change THEN the system SHALL automatically update all relevant forecasts and generate impact assessments
4. IF historical patterns suggest emerging risks THEN the system SHALL generate early warning reports with specific mitigation strategies

### Requirement 3: Multimodal Content Intelligence

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to analyze customer feedback, product images, support tickets, and sales data together to understand product performance holistically, so that I can make data-driven product decisions that improve customer satisfaction and revenue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing product performance THEN the system SHALL combine structured sales data with unstructured customer reviews, support images, and social media content
2. WHEN product images are uploaded THEN the system SHALL automatically extract features and correlate them with customer sentiment and sales performance
3. WHEN customer support tickets include images THEN the system SHALL analyze visual content to identify common issues and generate automated resolution suggestions
4. IF discrepancies exist between product specifications and actual images THEN the system SHALL flag quality control issues with detailed analysis

### Requirement 4: Real-time Collaborative Intelligence

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want the system to automatically generate insights and recommendations during meetings by analyzing our discussion context against historical data and similar past decisions, so that we can make better decisions faster with full organizational knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN meeting transcripts are processed THEN the system SHALL identify key decision points and automatically surface relevant historical context
2. WHEN action items are discussed THEN the system SHALL generate implementation recommendations based on similar past initiatives
3. WHEN strategic questions arise THEN the system SHALL provide real-time answers by querying and synthesizing information from all available data sources
4. IF conflicting information is found THEN the system SHALL highlight discrepancies and provide reconciliation suggestions

### Requirement 5: Automated Insight Distribution and Personalization

**User Story:** As a department head, I want to receive personalized, actionable insights relevant to my role and current projects delivered automatically, so that I can stay informed and make timely decisions without manually searching through data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new insights are generated THEN the system SHALL automatically determine relevant stakeholders based on role, project involvement, and historical interest patterns
2. WHEN distributing insights THEN the system SHALL generate personalized summaries tailored to each recipient's role and current priorities
3. WHEN urgent situations are detected THEN the system SHALL immediately alert relevant personnel with context-aware recommendations
4. IF insights require action THEN the system SHALL generate specific, actionable recommendations with success probability estimates

### Requirement 6: Enterprise-Scale Performance and Security

**User Story:** As a CTO, I want the system to handle our enterprise-scale data volumes while maintaining strict security and compliance standards, so that we can leverage AI capabilities without compromising data governance or system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-second response times for queries up to 100TB of data
2. WHEN handling sensitive information THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based access controls and maintain complete audit trails
3. WHEN scaling operations THEN the system SHALL automatically optimize vector indices and AI model performance
4. IF compliance requirements change THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust data handling and retention policies
