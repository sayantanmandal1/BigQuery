    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a revolutionary AI-powered system that transforms enterprise data into actionable intelligence using **ALL THREE** BigQuery AI approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🧠 **Generative AI**: AI.GENERATE, AI.FORECAST, AI.GENERATE_BOOL\n",
    "- 🕵️ **Vector Search**: ML.GENERATE_EMBEDDING, VECTOR_SEARCH\n",
    "- 🖼️ **Multimodal**: Object Tables, ObjectRef\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Problem\n",
    "Enterprises have massive amounts of unstructured data (documents, images, chat logs) but can't extract meaningful insights. This platform solves that by creating an intelligent knowledge system that understands context, predicts trends, and generates personalized insights.\n",
