- Embedding generation using ML.GENERATE_EMBEDDING
- Vector search functionality with VECTOR_SEARCH
- Insight generation using AI.GENERATE
- Personalized content delivery

#### 2. Multi-Engine Integration Test
```sql
CALL `enterprise_ai.test_multi_engine_integration`();
```
**Validates:**
- Semantic intelligence + predictive analytics integration
- Multimodal analysis + real-time insights integration
- Cross-engine data correlation and synthesis
- Personalized intelligence across all engines

#### 3. Performance Regression Test
```sql
CALL `enterprise_ai.test_performance_regression`();
```
**Validates:**
- Enterprise-scale vector search performance
- Bulk AI generation performance
- End-to-end pipeline performance
- Performance baseline compliance

### Master Test Execution
```sql
CALL `enterprise_ai.run_all_integration_tests`();
```
Executes all integration tests in sequence and provides comprehensive results.

## Performance Baselines

| Test Category | Metric | Baseline | Threshold |
|---------------|--------|----------|-----------|
| Vector Search | Avg Query Time | 500ms | ±25% |
| Vector Search | Queries/Second | 100 | ±15% |
| AI Generation | Avg Generation Time | 1500ms | ±40% |
| AI Generation | Tokens/Second | 25 | ±25% |
| End-to-End Pipeline | Total Time | 10000ms | ±50% |

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Health Status Check
```sql
SELECT `enterprise_ai.get_integration_health_status`();
```
Returns comprehensive health status including:
- Overall system health (HEALTHY/WARNING/CRITICAL)
- Test success rates
- Performance metrics
- Data quality scores

### Performance Dashboard
```sql
SELECT * FROM `enterprise_ai.performance_monitoring_dashboard`;
```
Provides real-time performance monitoring with:
- Current vs baseline performance comparison
- Performance trend analysis
- Alert priority levels

### Test Reports
```sql
SELECT * FROM `enterprise_ai.integration_test_report`;
```
Comprehensive test reporting including:
- Test execution statistics
- Success/failure rates
- Performance metrics
- Quality scores

## Automated Alerting

### Alert Generation
```sql
CALL `enterprise_ai.check_integration_alerts`();
```
Automatically generates alerts for:
- **CRITICAL**: System failures or severe performance degradation
- **WARNING**: Performance issues or test failures
- **INFO**: System status updates

### Alert Types
- **PERFORMANCE**: Performance degradation beyond thresholds
- **FAILURE**: Test failures or system errors
- **HEALTH**: Overall system health status changes

## Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Core Enterprise Knowledge Intelligence Platform deployed
- Required AI models (text_embedding_model, gemini_model) available
- Core tables (enterprise_knowledge_base, generated_insights, user_interactions) created

### Deployment Steps
1. **Deploy Integration Framework**:
   ```sql
   -- Execute deployment script
   @error-handling/deploy_integration_tests.sql
   ```

2. **Verify Deployment**:
   ```sql
   SELECT `enterprise_ai.verify_test_prerequisites`();
   ```

3. **Run Initial Tests**:
   ```sql
   CALL `enterprise_ai.run_all_integration_tests`();
   ```

## Maintenance

### Data Cleanup
```sql
CALL `enterprise_ai.cleanup_integration_test_data`(30); -- Keep 30 days
```
Automatically cleans up:
- Old test results
- Historical test data
- Resolved alerts

### Baseline Updates
Update performance baselines when system improvements are made:
```sql
UPDATE `enterprise_ai.performance_baselines`
SET baseline_value = new_value, last_updated = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
WHERE test_name = 'test_name' AND metric_name = 'metric_name';
```

## Integration with CI/CD

### Automated Testing Schedule
Set up automated testing through Cloud Scheduler:
- **Daily**: Full integration test suite
- **Weekly**: Performance regression analysis
- **Monthly**: Baseline review and updates

### Quality Gates
Use integration test results as quality gates:
- **Green**: All tests pass, performance within baselines
- **Yellow**: Minor performance degradation or non-critical failures
- **Red**: Critical failures or significant performance regression

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Test Failures
1. **Check Prerequisites**: Ensure all required models and tables exist
2. **Verify Permissions**: Confirm service account has necessary BigQuery permissions
3. **Review Error Messages**: Check integration_test_results table for detailed error information

#### Performance Issues
1. **Check Baselines**: Verify performance baselines are realistic for current system
2. **Resource Scaling**: Ensure BigQuery has sufficient slots for test execution
3. **Data Volume**: Consider reducing test data volume if performance is consistently poor

#### Alert Fatigue
1. **Adjust Thresholds**: Fine-tune performance thresholds based on actual system behavior
2. **Alert Prioritization**: Focus on CRITICAL alerts first
3. **Baseline Updates**: Regularly update baselines to reflect system improvements

## Best Practices

### Test Execution
- Run integration tests during low-traffic periods
- Monitor resource usage during test execution
- Maintain separate test datasets to avoid production impact

### Performance Monitoring
- Regularly review and update performance baselines
- Track performance trends over time
- Investigate performance degradation promptly

### Alert Management
- Establish clear escalation procedures for different alert levels
- Regularly review and resolve alerts
- Use alert data to identify system improvement opportunities
