# Multimodal Analysis Engine

The Multimodal Analysis Engine is a comprehensive AI-powered system that combines visual content analysis with structured data to generate actionable business intelligence. This engine leverages BigQuery's multimodal AI capabilities to analyze images, documents, and support tickets alongside business metrics.

## Overview

This engine addresses Requirements 3.1-3.4 from the Enterprise Knowledge Intelligence Platform specification:

- **3.1**: Multimodal content intelligence combining structured and unstructured data
- **3.2**: Visual content analysis with feature extraction and correlation
- **3.3**: Quality control system detecting discrepancies between modalities
- **3.4**: Cross-modal correlation for comprehensive business insights

## Components

### 1. Visual Content Analyzer (`visual_content_analyzer.sql`)

Analyzes visual content using ObjectRef for image processing:

- **Product Image Analysis**: Evaluates product images against specifications
- **Document Feature Extraction**: Extracts text, tables, and key information from document images
- **Support Image Analysis**: Analyzes customer support images for problem identification
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently processes large volumes of visual content

**Key Functions**:
- `analyze_product_image()`: Analyzes product images for quality and feature assessment
- `extract_document_features()`: Extracts structured data from document images
- `analyze_support_image()`: Processes support ticket images for issue resolution
- `batch_analyze_visual_content()`: Processes unanalyzed visual content in batches

### 2. Cross-Modal Correlation Engine (`cross_modal_correlation.sql`)

Combines insights from images and structured data to identify relationships:

- **Product Performance Correlation**: Links visual features with sales performance
- **Customer Feedback Correlation**: Correlates visual evidence with customer complaints
- **Pattern Identification**: Discovers cross-modal patterns across all content types
- **Business Intelligence Generation**: Creates actionable insights from correlations

**Key Functions**:
- `correlate_product_performance()`: Analyzes correlation between visual appeal and sales
- `correlate_customer_feedback()`: Validates customer claims against visual evidence
- `identify_cross_modal_patterns()`: Discovers patterns across different data modalities
- `generate_cross_modal_insights()`: Creates comprehensive correlation analysis

### 3. Quality Control System (`quality_control_system.sql`)

Detects discrepancies between different modalities:

- **Product Specification Validation**: Compares product specs with visual appearance
- **Document Accuracy Verification**: Validates document metadata against visual content
- **Support Resolution Verification**: Ensures resolutions match visual problem analysis
- **Automated Quality Auditing**: Runs comprehensive quality control checks

**Key Functions**:
- `detect_product_discrepancies()`: Identifies mismatches between specs and visuals
- `validate_document_accuracy()`: Checks document content consistency
- `verify_support_resolution()`: Validates support ticket resolutions
- `run_quality_control_audit()`: Executes comprehensive quality control procedures

### 4. Comprehensive Multimodal Analysis (`comprehensive_multimodal_analysis.sql`)

Implements AI.GENERATE with multimodal inputs for holistic analysis:

- **Product Analysis**: Combines visual, sales, and market data for strategic recommendations
- **Customer Journey Analysis**: Analyzes complete customer interactions across modalities
- **Market Intelligence**: Provides comprehensive market analysis with visual trend identification
- **Strategic Intelligence Generation**: Creates executive-level insights from multimodal data

**Key Functions**:
- `comprehensive_product_analysis()`: Holistic product performance analysis
- `comprehensive_customer_journey_analysis()`: Complete customer experience evaluation
- `comprehensive_market_analysis()`: Market intelligence with visual trend analysis
- `generate_comprehensive_intelligence()`: Creates strategic business intelligence

## Testing Framework
