# Example Cloud Scheduler job
gcloud scheduler jobs create http security-compliance-tests \
  --schedule="0 2 * * *" \
  --uri="https://your-cloud-function-url/run-security-tests" \
  --http-method=POST \
  --description="Daily security and compliance testing"
```

### Real-Time Monitoring
Configure continuous monitoring for immediate threat detection:

```sql
-- Schedule continuous monitoring (every 15 minutes)
CALL schedule_security_compliance_tests();
```

## Security Policies

The framework enforces the following security policies:

### Access Control Policy
- **Executive**: Access to PUBLIC, INTERNAL, CONFIDENTIAL data across all departments
- **Manager**: Access to PUBLIC, INTERNAL data within same department
- **Analyst**: Access to PUBLIC, INTERNAL data within same department (no financial data)
- **Viewer**: Access to PUBLIC data within same department only

### Data Retention Policy
- **User Interactions**: 3 years (archive after 1 year)
- **Knowledge Base**: 7 years (archive after 2 years)
- **Audit Trail**: 10 years (archive after 3 years)
- **Compliance Reports**: Permanent (archive after 5 years)

### Encryption Policy
- **CONFIDENTIAL/RESTRICTED**: AES-256 encryption required
- **PII/Financial/Healthcare**: AES-256 encryption required
- **RESTRICTED**: Additional HSM and key rotation controls

## Compliance Frameworks

### GDPR Compliance
- Data processing consent tracking
- Right to be forgotten implementation
- Data portability support
- Privacy impact assessments

### SOX Compliance

## Metrics and KPIs

### Security Metrics
- **Overall Compliance Score**: Percentage of tests passing
- **Critical Issues**: Number of critical security failures
- **Mean Time to Remediation**: Average time to fix security issues
- **Security Incident Rate**: Number of security incidents per month

### Compliance Metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### High False Positive Rate in PII Detection
- **Cause**: AI model being overly sensitive
- **Solution**: Adjust AI prompt or implement confidence thresholds
- **Code**: Modify `test_pii_protection()` procedure

#### Missing Audit Records
- **Cause**: Application not properly logging interactions
- **Solution**: Verify audit logging is enabled in all components
- **Code**: Check audit trail insertion triggers

#### Access Control Violations
- **Cause**: Role assignments not properly synchronized
- **Solution**: Implement role synchronization process
- **Code**: Review user role assignment procedures

### Performance Optimization

#### Large Dataset Processing
- Use partitioned tables for better query performance
- Implement incremental testing for large datasets
- Consider sampling for non-critical tests

#### AI Model Optimization
- Cache frequently used AI model results
- Implement batch processing for AI-powered tests
- Use appropriate model sizes for different test types

## Integration with Existing Systems

### SIEM Integration
Export security alerts to your SIEM system:

```sql
-- Export security alerts for SIEM ingestion
SELECT 
  alert_id,
  alert_type,
  severity,
  message,
  created_timestamp,
  JSON_EXTRACT(metadata, '$.source_ip') AS source_ip,
  JSON_EXTRACT(metadata, '$.user_id') AS user_id
FROM `enterprise_knowledge_ai.security_alerts`
WHERE created_timestamp >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 1 HOUR)
AND acknowledged = FALSE;
```

### Identity Management Integration
Synchronize with your identity provider:

```sql
-- Sync user roles from identity provider
MERGE `enterprise_knowledge_ai.user_roles` AS target
USING `identity_provider.user_roles` AS source
ON target.user_id = source.user_id
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET
  department = source.department,
  role_name = source.role_name,
  authorized_roles = source.authorized_roles,
  last_updated = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT
  (user_id, department, role_name, authorized_roles, created_timestamp)
VALUES
  (source.user_id, source.department, source.role_name, source.authorized_roles, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP());
```
