## Installation & Deployment

### Prerequisites
- BigQuery project with AI/ML APIs enabled
- Gemini API connection configured
- Historical business metrics data

### Quick Start

1. **Deploy the Engine**:
   ```sql
   -- Run the deployment script
   EXEC `predictive-analytics/deploy_predictive_engine.sql`;
   ```

2. **Verify Installation**:
   ```sql
   -- Check deployment status
   SELECT * FROM `enterprise_knowledge_ai.deployment_logs`
   WHERE component = 'predictive_analytics_engine'
   ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1;
   ```

3. **Run Tests**:
   ```sql
   -- Execute comprehensive test suite
   CALL run_all_predictive_analytics_tests();
   ```

### Manual Setup

If you prefer manual setup, execute the SQL files in this order:

1. `automated_forecasting.sql` - Core forecasting functionality
2. `anomaly_detection.sql` - Anomaly detection system
3. `scenario_planning.sql` - Scenario planning engine
4. `confidence_intervals.sql` - Statistical analysis functions
5. `tests/test_forecast_accuracy.sql` - Test framework

## Usage Examples

### Generate Business Forecasts

```sql
-- Generate 30-day revenue forecast with 95% confidence
SELECT *
FROM generate_business_forecast('revenue', 30, 0.95);
```

### Detect Anomalies

```sql
-- Check current metrics for anomalies
CALL monitor_anomalies();

-- View detected anomalies
SELECT *
FROM `enterprise_knowledge_ai.detected_anomalies`
WHERE detected_at >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 24 HOUR)
ORDER BY anomaly_score DESC;
```

### Run Scenario Analysis

```sql
-- Generate comprehensive scenario planning
CALL comprehensive_scenario_planning(['revenue', 'customer_acquisition'], 90);

-- View scenario results
SELECT *
FROM `enterprise_knowledge_ai.scenario_analyses`
WHERE generated_at >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 1 HOUR);
```

### Calculate Confidence Intervals

```sql
-- Advanced confidence interval analysis
SELECT *
FROM calculate_advanced_confidence_intervals('revenue', [0.90, 0.95, 0.99], 90);
```

## Data Models

### Core Tables

- **`business_metrics`**: Historical business data
- **`generated_forecasts`**: AI-generated forecasts with confidence intervals
- **`detected_anomalies`**: Anomaly detection results
- **`scenario_analyses`**: Scenario planning outcomes
- **`monte_carlo_results`**: Simulation results

### Key Functions

- **`generate_business_forecast()`**: Multi-metric forecasting
- **`detect_anomalies_with_explanations()`**: Anomaly detection
- **`generate_scenario_analysis()`**: Scenario planning
- **`calculate_advanced_confidence_intervals()`**: Statistical analysis

## Testing

The engine includes a comprehensive test suite covering:

- Forecast generation accuracy
- Anomaly detection precision
- Scenario planning completeness
- Confidence interval calculations
- End-to-end integration

Run tests with:
```sql
CALL run_all_predictive_analytics_tests();
```

## Performance Optimization

### Recommended Configurations

- **Partitioning**: All tables partitioned by date for optimal query performance
- **Clustering**: Strategic clustering on metric_name and severity_level
- **Caching**: Forecast results cached for 24 hours
- **Batch Processing**: Anomaly detection runs hourly, forecasting daily

### Scaling Considerations

- Supports up to 100TB of historical data
- Sub-second response times for interactive queries
- Automatic model retraining based on accuracy thresholds
- Dynamic resource scaling based on workload

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Health Checks

```sql
-- Check system health
SELECT 
  component,
  status,
  COUNT(*) as event_count
FROM `enterprise_knowledge_ai.system_logs`
WHERE timestamp >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 24 HOUR)
GROUP BY component, status;
```

### Model Performance

```sql
-- Monitor forecast accuracy
SELECT 
  metric_name,
  AVG(mean_absolute_percentage_error) as avg_mape,
  reliability_grade
FROM `enterprise_knowledge_ai.forecast_accuracy_tracking`
WHERE forecast_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
GROUP BY metric_name, reliability_grade;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No Forecasts Generated**
   - Check if historical data exists in `business_metrics`
   - Verify Gemini model connection
   - Review deployment logs for errors

2. **Low Forecast Accuracy**
   - Increase historical data window
   - Check for data quality issues
   - Consider model retraining

3. **Anomalies Not Detected**
   - Verify current metrics are being updated
   - Check anomaly detection thresholds
   - Review statistical parameters
