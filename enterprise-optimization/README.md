## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Deploy the System

```sql
-- Execute the deployment script
@enterprise-optimization/deploy_optimization_system.sql
```

### 2. Verify Deployment

The deployment script includes validation queries that check:
- All required tables are created
- All procedures and functions are deployed
- System health check passes

### 3. Configure Monitoring

```sql
-- Set up custom alert configurations
INSERT INTO `enterprise_knowledge_ai.alert_configuration`
(alert_id, alert_name, component_name, metric_name, condition_type, 
 warning_threshold, critical_threshold, evaluation_window_minutes, notification_channels)
VALUES 
('custom_alert', 'Custom Performance Alert', 'your_component', 'your_metric', 
 'threshold', 100.0, 200.0, 10, ['email', 'slack']);
```

### 4. Schedule Automated Operations

Set up external scheduling (e.g., Cloud Scheduler) to run:

```sql
-- Run every 5 minutes for real-time optimization
CALL run_enterprise_optimization_cycle();

-- Run daily for comprehensive load testing
CALL run_automated_load_tests();
```

## Usage Examples

### Monitor System Health

```sql
-- Get current system health status
SELECT check_optimization_system_health();

-- View real-time dashboard
SELECT * FROM `enterprise_knowledge_ai.realtime_dashboard`;
```

### Execute Load Testing

```sql
-- Run a specific load test scenario
CALL execute_load_test_scenario('vector_search_stress');

-- Analyze test results
SELECT analyze_load_test_results('your_test_run_id');
```

### Manual Optimization

```sql
-- Run optimization cycle manually
CALL run_optimization_cycle();

-- Check for performance regressions
SELECT detect_performance_regression('semantic_engine', 'avg_latency_ms', 1500.0);
```

## Performance Metrics

The system tracks and optimizes the following key metrics:

### Response Time Metrics
- **Vector Search Latency**: Target < 2000ms (warning), < 5000ms (critical)
- **AI Function Response Time**: Target < 5000ms (warning), < 10000ms (critical)
- **End-to-End Query Time**: Target < 3000ms (warning), < 8000ms (critical)

### Throughput Metrics
- **Queries Per Second**: Monitored per component with dynamic scaling
- **Concurrent Users**: Supports up to 2000+ concurrent users
- **Data Processing Rate**: Optimized for 100TB+ datasets

### Resource Utilization
- **CPU Utilization**: Target < 80% (scale up), < 30% (scale down)
- **Memory Usage**: Target < 85% (scale up), < 40% (scale down)
- **Cost Efficiency**: Continuous cost optimization with ROI tracking

## Alerting and Notifications

### Alert Types
- **Performance Alerts**: Response time and throughput degradations
- **Resource Alerts**: High utilization and scaling events

### Notification Channels
- **Email**: Detailed alert information and reports
- **Slack**: Real-time notifications and status updates
- **PagerDuty**: Critical alerts requiring immediate attention

## Best Practices

### 1. Monitoring Configuration
- Set appropriate alert thresholds based on your SLA requirements
- Configure multiple notification channels for redundancy
- Regularly review and adjust baseline performance metrics

### 2. Scaling Configuration
- Set conservative scaling thresholds initially and adjust based on patterns
- Configure appropriate cooldown periods to prevent oscillation
- Monitor cost impact of scaling decisions

### 3. Load Testing
- Run regular load tests to validate performance under expected loads
- Test during different time periods to understand usage patterns
- Use realistic data volumes and query patterns in tests

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Allow the system to establish baselines before making manual optimizations
- Review optimization recommendations before applying them
- Monitor the impact of optimizations and roll back if necessary

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **High Response Times**
   - Check vector index optimization status
   - Review query patterns for optimization opportunities
   - Consider scaling up compute resources

2. **Scaling Issues**
   - Verify scaling configuration thresholds
   - Check cooldown periods aren't too restrictive
   - Review cost-benefit calculations

3. **Alert Fatigue**
   - Adjust alert thresholds to reduce false positives
   - Implement alert grouping and suppression rules
   - Review notification channel configurations

### Diagnostic Queries

```sql
-- Check recent optimization activities
SELECT * FROM `enterprise_knowledge_ai.system_events`
WHERE event_type = 'OPTIMIZATION'
  AND timestamp >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 24 HOUR)
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- Review performance trends
SELECT * FROM `enterprise_knowledge_ai.dashboard_performance_summary`
WHERE date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
ORDER BY date DESC, component_name;

-- Check active alerts
SELECT * FROM `enterprise_knowledge_ai.system_events`
WHERE event_type = 'ALERT'
  AND resolved = FALSE
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```
